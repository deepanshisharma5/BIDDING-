# BIDDING

Project: Bidding Auction Game in Python
This is a fun and interactive command-line bidding system created using Python. The project simulates a live auction where multiple participants can place bids, and the program determines the highest bidder. It’s a great beginner project to practice dictionaries, loops, and functions.

🎮 Game Overview
The program starts with a welcoming ASCII art of a mansion being auctioned. Each participant is prompted to enter their name and bid amount. The auction continues until no more bidders remain. After that, the program announces the winner — the person who placed the highest bid.

💡 Features
🔤 Accepts bidder name and bid amount
🧠 Automatically calculates the highest bid
❌ Handles invalid (non-integer) bid inputs
🔁 Allows continuous bidding until stopped
🏆 Declares the winner with the highest bid at the end
🎨 Includes stylized ASCII art for visual appeal

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Core concepts: input(), int(), try-except, dict, loops, functions
